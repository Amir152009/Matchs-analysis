# ⚽ Football Match Data Analysis – "Investigate a Dataset"

This is my **first ever data analysis project**, completed about a year and a half ago as part of a learning track focused on **Data Science and AI**.  
The main goal of the project was to practice **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and extract meaningful insights from a real-world football match dataset.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The project investigates football match data from multiple European leagues to answer questions like:

- 🥇 Which team is the best in each league?
- 📈 Which teams have improved over time?
- 🏟️ Which teams score the most at home vs. away?

> Note: The focus of this project was **on analysis, not on data cleaning**. The dataset was mostly used as-is, with only minor adjustments where necessary.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains match-level data across several European football leagues.  

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – data manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – for exploration and documentation

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- Displayed the **best-performing team** in each league using a styled table.
- Tracked **performance trends over time** for selected teams.
- Analyzed **goal scoring patterns** at home and away for top clubs.

## 🙋 About This Project

This was my **first hands-on data project**. I created it during my early learning phase to get comfortable with real-world datasets, asking questions, and telling stories through data.  
It's not perfect, but it's where the journey began 😊

## 🚀 What's Next?

Since then, I've continued to improve my skills and work on more advanced projects involving cleaning, modeling, and building full pipelines.  
But this one remains a key milestone in my learning path.
